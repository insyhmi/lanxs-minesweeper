# Lanx's Minesweeper

A minesweeper game made with Python and passion.

# Objective

This game is part of my process of learning the Python's Pygame library.

# Gameplay

The objective the game (along with other well-known iterations of minesweeper) is to find all the mines in the grid and clear the rest of the ground. 
The game informs the player about the number of mines that they require to find, and they can flag a cell to mark it as a mine for their reference.
The game concludes a win when the player succeeds in clearing all empty cells, or a loss if otherwise.
